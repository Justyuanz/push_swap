# push_swap

> A sorting algorithm project using two stacks and a limited set of instructions, built in C.

## About

`push_swap` is a project from Hive Helsinki where the goal is to sort a stack of integers with the smallest number of operations possible, using only specific stack-based instructions (`sa`, `pb`, `ra`, etc.).  
The challenge is to write an efficient algorithm under strict constraints, both in terms of performance and allowed operations.
